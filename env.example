# Environment variables for AI Album Generator

## Authentication
#
# AUTH_SECRET is required and should be a strong random string.  It is used
# to sign cookies and JSON Web Tokens.  You can generate one with
# `openssl rand -base64 32`.
AUTH_SECRET=

# Google OAuth client id and secret.  Create credentials in the Google
# Cloud Console and add your production and preview domains to the
# authorized redirect URIs.  Example: https://myapp.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=

# When deploying behind a proxy (e.g. Vercel), set AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true so
# Auth.js trusts the host header for callback URL generation.  In local
# development this should remain unset or false.
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true

## Canonical host
#
# Optionally set CANONICAL_HOST to force all requests to redirect to this
# hostname in production.  For example: ai-album-gen.vercel.app
CANONICAL_HOST=

## Development/testing
#
# TEST_PASSWORD enables the credentials provider in development and tests.
# During automated tests (e.g. Playwright) sign in by submitting this
# password.  Never enable this in production.
TEST_PASSWORD=secret-test-password

# When MOCK_OPENAI=true the AI image generator will return a static
# placeholder image instead of calling the OpenAI API.  Useful for local
# development and CI environments without API access.
MOCK_OPENAI=true

## OpenAI API
#
# OPENAI_API_KEY is required in production to call the DALLÂ·E API.  Leave
# unset when using MOCK_OPENAI.
OPENAI_API_KEY=
