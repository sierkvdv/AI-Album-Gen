/**
 * Generate an album cover image using an AI model.
 *
 * In a production environment this function would call the OpenAI DALL·E API
 * (or another generative model) with the provided prompt and style and
 * return the URL to the generated image.  However, for development and
 * testing environments we support a fallback that returns a static
 * placeholder image.  The fallback is used when the `MOCK_OPENAI` environment
 * variable is set to `true` or when the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing.  This
 * allows the API routes to operate without depending on external services.
 *
 * @param prompt The user provided prompt describing the cover.
 * @param style  A human‑readable description of the style preset.
 * @returns A URL string pointing to the generated (or placeholder) image.
